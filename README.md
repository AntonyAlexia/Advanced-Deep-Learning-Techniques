Advanced Deep Learning Techniques
This project demonstrates the application of advanced deep learning techniques to sequential data and natural language processing (NLP). The project is divided into three parts:

Part 1: Temperature Forecasting using RNNs
Objective: Predict temperature using weather data.
Techniques: Feature engineering, data normalization, and hyperparameter tuning.
Dataset: Weather data from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, covering 2009â€“2016.
Part 2: Sentiment Analysis using LSTMs
Objective: Classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.
Techniques: Handling data imbalance, using pre-trained embeddings (GloVe/Word2Vec).
Dataset: IMDB movie review dataset.
Part 3: NLP using Transformers
Objective: Implement machine translation from English to Spanish.
Techniques: Self-attention mechanisms, tokenization, and text preprocessing.
Framework: Transformer architecture.
